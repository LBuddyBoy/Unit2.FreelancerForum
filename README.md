This assigment taught me a lot about DOM manipulation and just the general rule of thumb when it comes to Fullstack Development.

I learned a lot about manipulating tables and workarounds for certain things I was trying to achieve

I also got the hang of cleaning up my code after I have it functional as well as writing comments to keep track of what I was doing
